<b>03/11/2021</b>
<a href="https://github.com/kevinloch/bsrender">bsrender</a> now supports an external star database for manually added stars that are too bright to be in the Gaia dataset.  It is also able to render Airy disks giving photorealistic quality and depth to renderings.  Star temperature (color) is now derived more accurately from the Gaia red, blue, and broadband sensor data.

<br>interesting programming challenge as well as being a fascinating trove of fresh data to explore.   The code is in a very "basic hack" state but

nle-lepton is an software program that searches for polynomial-like non-linear equations

<b>11/24/2018</b>
I wrote a program to search for polynomial-like formulas that have the charged lepton masses as their roots.   The hope is
<br>that such a formula would explain why there are exaclty three generations of matter, being the three real positive roots of a polynomial.
<br>The program searches for fractional exponent "polynomials" since using integer exponents would require six terms instead of three
<br>for three positive roots.   The program has found thousands of possible formulas that predict the non-input variables to within their experimental
<br>uncertainty but none of them have looked "simple" or "interesting" enough to publish so far. Since there are so many possible search factors
<br>I am publishing the source here so others can take a crack at it if they want.

Taken a few hours before the Lunar eclipse the color saturation was pushed during processing to exaggerate and reveal the
<br>subtle colors that are present on the moon even when it is not eclipsed.   Orange areas are due to an abundance of Iron oxide,

<a href="https://kevinloch.com/papers/fermion-yukawa-couplings.pdf">Empirically derived fermion Higgs Yukawa couplings and pole masses</a>
<p>
Abstract: <font size=-1>
Empirically derived formulas are proposed for calculating the Higgs field Yukawa couplings and<br>pole masses of the twelve known fundamental fermions with experimental inputs me, mu, and the<br>Fermi constant G0F.</font>
<p>
<b>11/11/2017</b>: Here is a physics paper I wrote about fundamental particle masses (original verion 2/27/2017):
<p>
<a href="https://kevinloch.com/papers/fermion-mass-hierarchy.pdf">A new empirical approach to lepton and quark masses</a>
<p>
Abstract: <font size=-1>
A novel alternative to the Koide formula and it's extensions is presented. A new lepton ratio with<br>a small dimensionless residual k_e = m_e m_t^2 / m_u^3 and mass scaling factor alpha_f = 27m_e / m_t are used to <br>construct empirical formulas for charged leptons, left-handed neutrinos and quarks. The predicted<br>masses are in excellent agreement with known experimental values and constraints.

<b>Hobbies</b>
<p>
I'm a terrible web designer but here are some websites I've built (and poorly maintained) over the years:
<list>
<li>A simple, ad-free "check your IP address" website that supports IPv6 with several easy to remember url's: <a href="https://ip6.me/">ip6.me</a>, <a href="https://ip4.me/">ip4.me</a>
<br>&nbsp; and <a href="https://whatismyv6.com/">whatismyv6.com</a>.   This site gets about 1.4 Million hits per day, mostly automated queries from scripts and various dynamic dns clients like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/inadyn-mt/">inadyn-mt</a>
<li>I launched one of the earlier image hosting sites <a href="https://www.brickshelf.com/">Brickshelf.com</a> in April 2000.   It is restricted to just LEGO related images.
<br>&nbsp; Today Brickshelf has over 4.8 Million pictures of original LEGO creations.  At it's peak in 2006 it was receiving over a million
<br>&nbsp page views from over 100,000 unique IP addresses per day.
<li>Brickshelf at one time also held the worlds most complete repository of LEGO instruction and catalog scans. For many years LEGO customer support
<br>&nbsp; sent people to Brickshelf if they had lost instructions to older sets.  That repository now lives at <a href="https://peeron.com/">Peeron.com</a>.
<li>For a while Brickshelf operated a generic image hosting site at maj.com (later moved to majhost.com) but had to shut
<br>&nbsp; it down as it was extremely unprofitable.
<li>Since 1997 my <a href="https://n3kl.org/">N3KL.org</a> ham radio site has run a solar storm monitor.   For several years the late 1990's the monitor gif's were deep linked
<br>&nbsp; to directly from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Bell">Art Bell</a> radio show homepage.  It was fun to watch the huge spike in traffic whenever he would say on the air "go to my
<br>&nbsp; website now!".  It is stil gets over a million deep links per day from several ham related sites like <a href="https://qrv.jp/">qrv.jp</a> and <a href="https://solarham.net/">solarham.net</a>.
<li>I once built a tiny webserver out of an <a href="https://kevinloch.com/atari/">Atari 800</a> and a Bridge Communications (now 3com) CS-210 terminal server.
</list>
<p>
Other hobby stuff:
<p>
<list>
<li>I was co-founder of the original <a href="https://www.brickfest.com/">BrickFest</a>, The world's first AFOL convention that operated from 2000-2005. Today there are over
35 AFOL
<br>&nbsp; conventions operating around the world.
<li>What do I build with LEGO? Usually large <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BkF1faNgPCe/">city buildings</a>.
<li>I operate (along with other volunteer control operators) two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio">Amateur radio</a> repeaters in the Washington DC area using the call
<br>&nbsp; sign N3KL.   145.13 MHz and 1286.1 MHz
</list>
<p>
<b>Trivia</b>
<p>
<list>
<li>While at Carpathia I was the engineer who had to shut down network connectiviy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload">Megaupload</a> when the FBI seized the file sharing site in 2012.
<li>My father Frank J. Loch (1943-2008) worked for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BivoU6zAgVu/">NASA</a> during the Apollo program as an engineer for the spacecraft communications systems.  In 1971
<br>&nbsp; he moved to Virginia and started working for the CIA.   While he never told me anything aobut his work at the CIA, I've been able to reverse engineer from public
<br>&nbsp; sources that he likely worked on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Data_System">Satellite Data System</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH-11_Kennen">KH-11</a>spy sstellites</a>.  According to wikipedia the first KH-11 satellite was launched
<br>&nbsp; on my 5th birthday.
<li>My grandfather's cousin invented the <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3086511A/">toaster oven</a>.  My father <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3588705A/">1</a> and brother <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5835687A/">1</a>,
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20040101208A1/">2</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6923437B2/">3</a> also have patents.
