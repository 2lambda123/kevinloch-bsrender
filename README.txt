 Billion Star 3D Rendering Engine
 Kevin M. Loch

  bsrender is a 3d rendering engine for the ESA's Gaia EDR3 data set of over a billion stars (with parallax data).  It generates PNG images
from any position inside or outside the galaxy.

Installation:

- Compile with gnu make.
- make sure the gaia_source containing the Gaia EDR3 compresed csv files is in (or symlinked to) the current directory
- run 'gaia-edr3-extract.sh'
- Create a 'galaxy.dat' file by concatenating one or more of the galazy-pqxxx.dat files.  For example to generate a galaxy.dat file with a minimum parallax quality
  of 10: 'cat galaxy-pq100.dat galaxy-pq050.dat galaxy-pq030.dat galaxy-pq020.dat galaxy-pq010.dat > galaxy.dat'
- Edit options in bsrender.cfg for desired camera settings.  Make sure bsrender.cfg is in current directory or use -c command line options to specify name and location
- run './bsrender', it will print a few progress messages and output to 'galaxy.png'

By default it will render a 360 degree cylindrically projected panorama of the entire sky from the sun with the following camera settings:
 Resolution: 1920x1080
 White balance: 4200K
 Color saturation: 4.0
 Pixel saturation magnitude: 7.0

Due to uncertainty in the parallax data of approximately 15 microarcseconds, things start to look weird as the camera is positioned a short distance away from the sun (more than 10 parsecs).  This is a limitation of the source data and not any bug or problem with the rendering engine.

Sample binary data files are available at https://kevinloch.com/bsrender/sample_data/poc/
The sample data repository has both the separate files generated by mkgalaxy and a few pre-combined files ready for use by bsrender.
